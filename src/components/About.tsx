          Hello, my name is Patrick Alberto Navarro VÃ¡squez, I am currently finishing my studies in Systems Engineering and Computer Science. On the other hand, I have been developing applications for the web since 2020, since my first approach to web development was through an HTML course and, little by little, it caught my attention and I decided to learn the technologies self-taught. necessary for this type of development.
